I used to do css switching for one of the gui I was working on.
 
I switched to vswitch, and I can observe that the organization gets a little bit better, as hoped in the original intent.

To be more precise, the intent is clearer in the js code.
With code like this:


```js
function openForm(){
    $('#surface').addClass('openform');
}
```

You have to check the css to see what it does,
and in the worst case, where you have multiple switch classes on the surface, you have to mind debug what's the outcome.

On the positive side though, you have control on css transitions.

But now with vswitch, the code is js only (at least in fade/show mode):

```js
function openForm(){
    surfaceVswitch.kickIn('openform');
}
```

Which makes it easier to spot what happens in the gui.

That might seem to be not a lot, but as the number views grows, the advantage becomes more and more obvious.

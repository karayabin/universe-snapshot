So now we have in and out callbacks, which is great,
and we also have an init callback, but this one is only triggered if the view is in the starting pool (starter option).

However, I've stumbled upon this case (which seems reasonably common) where I have some js logic to bind to a view,
but only once.

The problem with the current implementation, is that if I use the in callback of the view, my logic gets executed
EVERY TIME the view kicks in.

A simple workaround is to keep track of a global boolean flag, but I thought that since it's a recurrent issue,
it should be handled internally by the vswitch object.


I have two ideas:

- either add a third argument: boolean flag firstTime to the in callback.
- or execute the init callback once per view, whenever the view kicks in (upon init OR other methods, not just init)

My personal preference would be for the second implementation, since it tends to create more organized code
(you don't have to make an if condition with the second solution).

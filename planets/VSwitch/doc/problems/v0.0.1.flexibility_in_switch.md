So now we can use automated view switching via js, pretty cool.
But for now, it's pretty rigid: we can only switch to ONE view, which means that all other views are discarded.

In real life though, we have composite views.
Also, imagine a form with error messages.
How do you remove the error messages?
One developer would prefer to remove all errors at once as soon as the user hits the keyboard for instance,
and another developer would only remove the fixed errors, one by one.
So it would be neat if we had more flexibility to enable/disable views.



Here is a proposal:


- switchView ( views )
            hide every views of the surface except for the given ones
- toggle ( views )
            toggle every given view (string|array) from its current state to the other (assuming a view has only 
            two states: visible/hidden).
            Note: this definition of views is used in other methods as well.
- kickIn ( views )
            set the given views to the visible state                
- kickOut ( views )
            set the given views to the hidden state
                            
                            
                            
Nomenclature proposal:
                            
- State of a view: hidden/visible

We Trust The Template (wttt)
=========================
2018-03-27


Wttt is just an approach to the following problem that we, model guys (in the mvc system) often have (at least
at first):

what kind of info do you pass to the template?

In particular, there are two types of strings that we might struggle with:

- which one of the following would you rather pass?
        - Info about client XYZ
        - XYZ
        
        
I believe there is no one-fit-all answer, I would just say:

- if you have a strong opinion about how your templates should look like, and you want the precise wording,
then maybe you can use the first approach, makes you feel more in control maybe?

- but, from now on, I will be a big fan of the second approach, the wttt approach, where we basically say:
        - "hey, template: here is the data, you know what to do with it (we trust you, template)"
        

What difference does it make?

Well, first, by doing so you get the immediate feeling that you are passing just what's needed.
I'm not going to argue about intuition, but try it for yourself and see how you feel.

So, if this is the approach you are going to take, then this means an important thing:

- language translation is done from/by the template (at least for those kind of data)

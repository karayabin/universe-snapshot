Octopus
=======
2019-02-07



A service container for your php apps.


This is part of the [universe framework](https://github.com/karayabin/universe-snapshot).


Install
==========
Using the [uni](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe-naive-importer) command.
```bash
uni import Octopus
```

Or just download it and place it where you want otherwise.





What's a service?
=================

In Octopus, a service is an object instance.

So for instance this is a service:

```php

class Animal{
}
$service = new Animal();
```


A service can be configured (by using arguments on the constructor, or calling methods on the instance),
and can virtually do anything.





What's an Octopus service container?
====================================

The Octopus service container is an object responsible for managing the services of your application.

Every time you want to access a service, you ask the service container and it gives the service back to you.

It's a centralized system.


What's special about Octopus?

- Octopus handles the lazy instantiation of your services for you, which means a service is only instantiated once when you call it. Every subsequent call to the same service returns the cached instance.
- Octopus can be exported as a static php class, thus improving the speed and the performances of your app in production.
- Octopus can also work in dynamic mode, making development sessions easier.
- To create services, Octopus uses the [sic notation](https://github.com/lingtalfi/NotationFan/blob/master/sic.md), which makes definition of services a trivial task.



Let's dive in
=============

Octopus comes with two versions:

- [red octopus](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Octopus/blob/master/doc/RedOctopusServiceContainer.md), the hot (aka dynamic) service container
- [blue octopus](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Octopus/blob/master/doc/BlueOctopusServiceContainer.md), the cold (aka static) service container

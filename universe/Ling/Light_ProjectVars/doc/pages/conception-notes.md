2021-06-11 -> 2021-06-28


Access variables specific to your project.


The following variables should be defined:



- project_name: the name of the project, from a code perspective, not the human name (i.e. can be used as an identifier in an array for instance).
- website: the website name, from a human perspective (i.e., mysite.com). This could be used in email communication for instance.

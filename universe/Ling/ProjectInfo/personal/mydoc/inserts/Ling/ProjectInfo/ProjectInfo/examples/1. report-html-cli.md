Example #1: an html or console report
------------------------------

The following code:

```php
$rootDir = "/komin/jin_site_demo";
$pinfo = new ProjectInfo($rootDir);
$pinfo->showReport([
    'followSymlinks' => true,
]);

```


Will print a different output based on the context from which it was printed from.

If it's called from a webserver, it will display the following:


![html report](http://lingtalfi.com/img/universe/ProjectInfo/project-info-html-report.png)


However, if it's called from a console, it will display the following:


![cli report](http://lingtalfi.com/img/universe/ProjectInfo/project-info-cli-report.png)

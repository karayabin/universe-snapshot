Description
================


public [MysqlStructureReader::readContent](https://github.com/lingtalfi/SqlWizard/blob/master/doc/api/Ling/SqlWizard/Util/MysqlStructureReader/readContent.md)(string $content) : array




Reads the given content and returns an array containing **table info items**, each of which having the following structure.

- db: string|null, the name of the database, or null if not specified
- table: string, the name of the table
- pk: array, the names of the columns of the primary key (or an empty array by default)
- uind: array, the unique indexes. Each entry of the array is itself an array representing one index.
    Each index is an array of column names composing the index.
- uindDetails: array, the unique indexes details. Same structure as the **indexes** property. See below for more details.
- indexes: array, the indexes details. The array contains items, each of which has the following entries:
     - name: string, the name of the index
     - keys: an array of the index keys, each of which being an array with the following entries:
         - colName: string, the name of the index column
         - ascDesc: ASC|DESC|null, a keyword indicating whether the index column is asc or desc or not set.


- fkeys: array, the foreign keys. It's an array of foreign key => references, with references being an array with
    the following structure:
    - 0: the referenced database, or null if it was not specified
    - 1: the referenced table
    - 2: the referenced column

     Note: this property is only useful if your foreign key is composed of one column and references one column.
     If your foreign key is composed of multiple columns and/or references multiple columns, consider using
     the fkeyDetails property instead.


- fkeyDetails: array, the array representing the foreign key details. It's an array of constraintName => fkInfo,
         with constraintName being the name of the foreign key constraint, and fkInfo being the following
         array:
         - fks: array of foreign key columns
         - references: (array)
             - table: the referenced table
             - columns: array, the referenced columns
         - onDelete: null | string(RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT) = null, the keyword associated with the ON DELETE option
         - onUpdate: null | string(RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT) = null, the keyword associated with the ON UPDATE option




- columnNames: array, the array of column names for this table
- columnTypes: array, the array of column name => column type. Each type is in lower string, and contains
    the information in parenthesis if any (for instance int, or varchar(64), or char(1), etc...)
- columnNullables: array, the array of column name => boolean (whether the column is nullable)
- ai: string|null = null, the name of the auto-incremented column if any
- referencedByTables: array of the tables defined in the given content that have a foreign key referencing this table.
     It's an array of "rb" items, each of which having the following structure:
     - 0: database, string or null
     - 1: table

- engine: string|null, the engine for this table

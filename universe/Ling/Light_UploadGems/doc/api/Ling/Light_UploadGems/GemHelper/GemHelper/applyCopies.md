             - copyIndex: the numerical index of this copy
             - copyItem: the copy configuration item (from the gem config)
     - onBeforeCopy: a callable triggered if there is at least one copy, and before the first copy is processed.
     - onCopyAfter: a callable triggered after the copy has been copied.
         The callable signature is:
         - onCopyAfter ( string $dst, int $copyIndex, array $copyItem )
             With:
             - dst: the destination path were the copy was written to

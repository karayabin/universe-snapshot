Realist conception notes
======================
2019-08-28 -> 2020-07-06



Overview
===========
2019-08-28


The goal of realist is to be the medium between the developer and the (my)sql database as far as fetching rows 
is concerned.


The main idea behind realist is to use a single interface: a [babyYaml](https://github.com/lingtalfi/BabyYaml) file,
so that the developer knows exactly where to look when he wants to change anything related to the list.



There are three sides in realist:

- the model
- the gui


Note: in the implementation the boundary between those two sides is sometimes blurry, so be forgiving.


The model part is described by the [duelist idea](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/doc/pages/duelist.md).


So basically the babyYaml file contains one or more **request declaration(s)**, and each **request declaration** controls the parameters
for one list.

A **request declaration** is an array of so-called settings.

In addition to the duelist idea, realist provides the following settings:  

- **rendering**: used to control the gui side (see more details in the **Rendering** section below) 
- ...(miscellaneous) 








   
Rendering
===========
2019-08-28

The **rendering** setting basically let us control (at least partially) the gui side of the list.

See an example later in this document.

 
 
 

List renderer
-------------
2019-08-28


A list renderer is basically the object which displays the list structure, including all gravitating widgets, such as the pagination,
the search widget, etc...

If we use an ajax based rows generator (which we recommend for admin tables), then the inner rows are generated separately
by a specialized object called the "rows renderer".







Rows renderer
--------------
2019-08-28


We basically provide an interface for rendering rows: **RealistRowsRendererInterface**.

This interface has the following methods:

- addDynamicColumn ( string colName, mixed position=post ):void
- setColumnType ( string colName, string type, array options=[] ):void
- setRic ( array ric ):void
- render  ( array rows ):string


The goal of this object is to return the html for the rows, which might be very specific to the
gui the application uses (for instance bootstrap 4).

Each column can have a type, which basically dictates how to render that particular column.

Most of the columns have regular text content, but sometimes we can have image that we would like
to render as img tags, or arrays that we would like to display as a list, or other things...



### Types, the column transformers
2019-08-28


Types (aka column transformers) allow us to transform the content of individual columns.
We can use type to transform an image url into an actual html img tag, or create links, or trim a too long content, etc.

Types are defined in the **rendering.rows_renderer.types** section, which is an array of type => typeConf.

With type being the name of the **type** (defaults to the value "text"), and **typeConf** being an array with the following structure:

- type: the type identifier, it helps identifying the plugin who will generate the transformation, and also indicate
        the type of transformation to execute. 
        We recommend that the type identifier has the following notation:
            - {pluginName}.{transformType}
        With:
            - {pluginName}: the plugin name            
            - {transformType}: an arbitrary string used by the plugin to know which type of transformation to apply            
- ...(other parameters, which might be used depending on the type of transformation)


In realist, our base renderer provides a few built-in types, including:

- Light_Realist.image, to transform an url into an html image tag            
- Light_Realist.hub_link, to create a link using the [controllerHub](transformType) service           
- Light_Realist.checkbox, to create an [Open Admin Table One](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/doc/pages/open-admin-table-helper-implementation-notes.md) compliant checkbox (containing the ric info)

See more in the code source of [the BaseRealistRowRenderer object](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/Rendering/BaseRealistRowsRenderer.php).         





### Dynamic columns

2019-08-28

Sometimes, we need to decorate the rows.

For instance, in an admin list, we often have an extra "action" column with some action buttons,
and/or we also have a checkbox column, which contains a simple checkbox to select the row.

One way of decorating the rows is to use dynamic columns.
Dynamic columns are columns that are dynamically added to the existing rows.


Two common dynamic columns for admin lists are "checkbox" and "action".


# Checkbox and Action special columns

2019-08-28 -> 2020-07-06


In the **rows_renderer** settings, we have two special properties:

- checkbox_column
- action_column

Both share similar characteristics:

- they are an array containing the following entries:
    - name: the name of the dynamic column
- if they are defined, they indicate that the dynamic column should be used, otherwise if they are not defined,
        they indicate that the dynamic column shouldn't be used.    


The default name for the checkbox dynamic column is "_checkbox".
The default name for the action dynamic column is "_action".

Note: the default name is used as long as you don't define the checkbox_column.name or action_column.name specifically. 




# About ric implementation

2019-08-28



We recommend using the [ric admin table helper](https://github.com/lingtalfi/JRicAdminTableHelper) js tool to handle
your ric related actions, but you can use any tool really. 
 
 
 
Hidden columns
--------- 
2019-11-12

Hidden columns are columns hidden from the view, but which data is still available.


### Why did I implement hidden columns ?

2019-08-28




I needed them when I wanted to create enhanced columns (aka crossed columns).

For instance, instead of displaying just the user_id (which was to my opinion not very useful for the administrator),
I wanted to display the user id AND the user pseudo or email.

So I replaced the basic user_id column with the enhanced user_id_plus column.

The problem in those admin tables, is that then when you need to do some actions on a row selection (for instance
if you want to print a set of selected rows, or delete them, or even add a link based on the ric), you need the ric information
of the row. 
So if the user_id is part of the ric (and it was in my case), replacing the user_id with the user_id_plus column caused the ric
to be lost. 

So my workaround to this problem was to hide the user_id column from the view rather than replacing it.
Yet the user_id information is still in the row, and so the ric being available in the html of the checkbox (at least
with my Bootstrap4AdminTable renderer), it was quite easy to hide columns, and still have the ric information available
for the rest of the gui.  


 
 
 
Cheatsheet for the developer
------------------------
2019-08-28


There are two sides to the realist:

- server side
    - to add custom column actions, override BaseRealistRowsRenderer (call setRealistRowsRendererGroup from the service configuration)
    - to add custom multiple rows actions, TODO...
- gui side
    - to setup the renderer, TODO...





List action groups
-----------------
2019-09-06


We suggest using the [list action handler conception notes](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/doc/pages/list-action-handler-conception-notes.md).   



List general actions 
-----------------
2019-09-25


Same as list action groups, except that they are using a **ListGeneralActionHandler** object to handle them.
The array structure used is the [generic action item](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/doc/pages/generic-action-item.md). 


### Button markup

2019-09-25


 
We recommend that a list general action button has the following markup:

- lgah-button: this css class should be added to the button/link.  
- data-action-id: this html attribute should be set, with the value being the value of the **action_id**.


We provide a **list-general-action-handler-helper.js** tool to help with the implementation.
      
      
### Js code
2019-09-25


The callable is the function f, same as for the list action handler, but the arguments are different:


- function f (jTrigger, jContainer, params);

With:

- jTrigger: the jquery element clicked by the user to trigger the action
- jContainer: the jquery element containing this realist gui
- params: the hep params bound to the jTrigger. More about hep parameters here: https://github.com/lingtalfi/NotationFan/blob/master/html-element-parameters.md


      
      
      
Related links
--------------
2019-10-28    


The related links section contains a list of related links.

Each link is an array: 
- text: the label of the link
- url: the url of the link
- ?icon: the css class of the icon if any

Because realist uses [duelist](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/blob/master/doc/pages/duelist.md) under the hood, you can use the dynamic injection notation from duelist
to specify your url as routes, as in the example below:
  
```yaml
related_links:
    -
        text: Add new user
        url: REALIST(Light_Realist, route, lka_route-user_add)
        icon: fas fa-plus-circle
```



Title
---------
2019-10-28


A list can have a title.
We can specify the title using the "title" entry.



Miscellaneous
============
2019-10-30


In this section, I present to you the "other" settings, that are not part of the duelist specification and not part of the rendering section.

- csrf_token: bool=true. Whether to protect the list against csrf attacks, using the [Light_CsrfSimple](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_CsrfSimple) service.
            
- plugin: string, the name of the plugin handling this realist request declaration.
        So far, it's used only as a prefix for micro-permission (see the use_micro_permission setting below).
        It might also be used by third party plugins as the handler of micro-permissions in general (for instance can the user delete rows in this table?),
        but that depends on the plugin.
        
- use_micro_permission: bool=true, whether to use the micro permission checking.
        We use the [micro permission notation recommendation for database](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_MicroPermission/blob/master/doc/pages/recommended-micropermission-notation.md#database-interaction).
        Since realist just provides access to the data, we check against the following micro-permission:
        
        - {pluginName}.tables.{table}.read
        
        With:
            - pluginName: the plugin string defined in the plugin setting (described just above)
            - table: the name of the table defined in the table setting (part of the duelist spec)

ParseDown
===========
2019-02-19


A markdown parser.


All credits goes to https://github.com/erusev/parsedown (i.e. I didn't touch the code)


I've just created a planet "shell" for the [ParseDown class](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/blob/master/Parsedown.php), 
so that users of the universe can import it via the [uni tool](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe-naive-importer) (the dependency manager of
the universe framework).  

 
 

  

This is part of the [universe framework](https://github.com/karayabin/universe-snapshot).


Install
==========
Using the [uni](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe-naive-importer) command.
```bash
uni import Ling/ParseDown
```

Or just download it and place it where you want otherwise.

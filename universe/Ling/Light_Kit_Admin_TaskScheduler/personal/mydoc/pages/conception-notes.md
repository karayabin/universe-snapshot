Light_Kit_Admin_TaskScheduler, conception notes
=============
2020-07-31


I'm very glad, because this whole planet, apart from this **conception notes**, and the **README.md** was basically entirely generated by the [Generate lka plugin task](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_DeveloperWizard/blob/master/doc/pages/task-details.md#generate-light_kit_admin-plugin).

So basically, I just clicked on a button to generate all that code.

Hopefully the code is a good one (otherwise that would suck).

This type of generation is new for me at the moment, so I might have to fix things later, since the lka plugin is not officially released yet and new features are going to be added, such as the top menu, and other things probably,
and therefore this generated plugin will probably need more work later.


So what's this planet all about? just some lka integrated gui (basic list and forms based on [Realist](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist/) and [Realform](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realform)) to interact with the db tables of the [Light_TaskScheduler](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_TaskScheduler) plugin.

===========
2020-06-30


A **create file** is a file that contains sql statements to create the tables for a given plugin.


This term was first coined by the [Light_DbSynchronizer plugin](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_DbSynchronizer/blob/master/doc/pages/conception-notes.md#create-file).

It turns out more plugin need to use it. 


It's recommended location is:

- $planetDir/assets/fixtures/create-structure.sql

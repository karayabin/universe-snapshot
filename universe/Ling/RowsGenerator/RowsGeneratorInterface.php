/**
 * The goal of this class is to return the rows shaped by the user,

 *
 *
 * The user can manipulate (usually via a gui) the returned rows using the following means:
 *
 * - selecting the current page, default is 1
 * - selecting the number of items per page, default is 20
 * - selecting the sorting of the rows, default is no sorting
 * - filtering the rows by search criterion, default is no search

     * If all searchItems match only then the value of the column matches.

     * searchItem: searchExpression ( | searchFilter )? |Â searchConstraint
     *
     * searchExpression: string, if the searchExpression is contained in the value of the column, there is a match
     * searchFilter: a callable which returns whether or not there is a match.
     *                  The callable takes the value of the column as its argument.
     *                  This is an optional feature, you don't have to implement it, but you can if you want.
     *                  The user should check the documentation of the concrete class to see if this feature is exposed.
     * searchConstraint: an array of two or three terms, describing how the value of the column should be matched against.
     *
     *                      The first entry is the operator,
     *                      subsequent entries are the operands.
     *                      Operators generally require one operand, except for the between operator which
     *                      requires two.
     *
     *                      Available operators are:
     *                      - <         (match if value < operand)
     *                      - <=
     *                      - >
     *                      - >=
     *                      - between    (this is the only operator which requires the two operands)
     *                      - =          (strict match)
     *                      - !=
     *                      - like
     *                      - %like     (matches only if the value of the column starts with the operand provided with this operator)
     *                      - like%     (matches only if the value of the column ends with the operand provided with this operator)

LightVarsService::resolveContainerNotation
================



LightVarsService::resolveContainerNotation â€” Resolves the container variables in the given string, if they are written in "container notation".




Description
================


public [LightVarsService::resolveContainerNotation](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Vars/blob/master/doc/api/Ling/Light_Vars/Service/LightVarsService/resolveContainerNotation.md)(string $str) : string




Resolves the container variables in the given string, if they are written in "container notation".


By container notation, we mean something like this:

- ${example_var}


So:

- a dollar symbol followed by an opening curly bracket
- the dot path to the variable to resolve (using the [bdot notation](https://github.com/karayabin/universe-snapshot/blob/master/universe/Ling/Bat/doc/bdot-notation.md))
- a closing bracket


Note: our heuristics doesn't necessarily use the same heuristics that the Light container does, we just
use the name "container notation" for our own purposes here.




Parameters
================


- str

    


Return values
================

Returns string.

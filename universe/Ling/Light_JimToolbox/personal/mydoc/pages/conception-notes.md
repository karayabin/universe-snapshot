Light_JimToolbox, conception notes
================
2021-07-08

The **jim toolbox**, or toolbox for short, is a little "widget" located on the side of the screen.

This widget is built upon the [JimToolbox planet](https://github.com/lingtalfi/JimToolbox).

So far, our implementations are optimized for the following environments:

- [Light_Kit](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Kit)

Plugins (aka third-party authors) can inject their own **toggle items**.






Registration
-------
2021-07-08

We use
an [open registration system](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light/blob/master/personal/mydoc/pages/design/open-vs-close-service-registration.md#the-open-registration)
.

Our service reads the **toggle items** from this file:

- config/open/Ling.Light_JimToolbox/items.byml

Each item's key is the **toggle item** identifier, which must be unique (because you can't have two entries with the
same key in an array).

Each item's value is an array with the following structure:

- label: string, the label of the **toggle item**
- icon: string, the css class to add to the icon (i.e. i tag), usually something like **fas fa-book**
- ?acp_class: string, the class name to call (via acp) when the **toggle item** is clicked. Your class should implement
  our **JimToolboxItemHandlerInterface** interface. It will be instantiated without parameters, and if you implement
  the [LightServiceContainerAwareInterface](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light/blob/master/doc/api/Ling/Light/ServiceContainer/LightServiceContainerAwareInterface.md)
  interface, the container will be set automatically.

- ?get: array, an array of extra parameters to pass via $_GET. Those params will be passed to the getPaneBody method of
  your acp class (if you use the **acp_class** property)

Note: as for now we only have the **acp_class** technique available. More content providing techniques might be added in
the future if we need them.


Accessing the items
--------
2021-07-08

Our service provides the **getJimToolboxItems** method, which returns a transformed version of the items array described
in the [registration section](#registration), where each item contains the following extra properties:

- current_uri: the current uri of the page. This might be useful if you use an ajax based system (such as acp), to
  access the information of the current main page (i.e., not the ajax page).
- url: if you use the **acp_class** property, the method will create the url to our dedicated controller, which
  basically will invoke the acp class that you defined. The idea is that when you click a **toggle item**, we call that
  special url, and our controller invokes your class to feed the content of the pane. That's just how the system works
  with the **acp_class** property.

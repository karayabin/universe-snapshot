This is a small class I wrote as a basic tool for writing menus.
My other option was to create the all object oriented version, which would have been more flexible and powerful, as it would
be easier to reposition elements within the menu.

However I stuck with this shorter implementation as it's faster to implement, seems faster (although I'm not sure),
and I believe I won't need to reposition the menu elements (if I do I'll need to create the oop version...).

Light_Logger Conception notes
=================
2019-08-01 -> 2020-11-30


This is a port of the [Ling\Jin\Log\Logger](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Jin/blob/master/Log/Logger.php) class,
which I made earlier for the jin framework (but the jin framework has been superseded by the light framework, hence the port).




I recommend using the following channels:

- **todo**: this channel will list the message for the developer. 
            I used it first in **Ling\Light_UserData\Controller\LightUserDataController**, to extend a mime type list
            when the extension provided was not yet listed.

- **error**: the error channel is explained in the [error logging convention](https://github.com/lingtalfi/TheBar/blob/master/discussions/error-logging-convention.md) document.

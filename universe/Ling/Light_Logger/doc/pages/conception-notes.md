Light_Logger Conception notes
=================
2019-08-01


This is a port of the [Ling\Jin\Log\Logger](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Jin/blob/master/Log/Logger.php) class
that I made earlier for the jin framework (but the jin framework has been superseded by the light framework, hence the port).




For a light application, I recommend the following channels (apart from the regular channels):

- todo: this channel will lists the message for the developer. 
            I used it first in **Ling\Light_UserData\Controller\LightUserDataController**, to extend a mime type list
            when the extension provided was not yet listed.

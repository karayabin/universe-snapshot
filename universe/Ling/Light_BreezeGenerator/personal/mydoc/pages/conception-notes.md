Light Breeze generator
==================
2019-09-11 -> 2020-05-21




The main idea
--------------

If you have the chance to use an IDE which can generate the basic getters and setters for you,
then maybe you enjoy the time that you've saved using those generators (instead of manually typing the methods).



The breeze generator is playing in the same category of tool.

It's delivered as a light service, so that you store your configuration directly in the corresponding 
service configuration file (rather than creating your own configuration memory system). 


It doesn't try to provide you with a new set of rules, (like I did with the [SaveOrm](https://github.com/lingtalfi/SaveOrm/)),
but rather, it humbly admits that it doesn't what you are going to do with your design,
and will try to help you at the typing level.



So basically, this tool will help you by saving you the typing of repetitive class writing.



As for now the available generators are:

- [LingBreezeGenerator2](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_BreezeGenerator/blob/master/doc/pages/ling-breeze-generator-2.md): my latest breeze generator
- [LingBreezeGenerator](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_BreezeGenerator/blob/master/doc/pages/ling-breeze-generator.md): my first breeze generator

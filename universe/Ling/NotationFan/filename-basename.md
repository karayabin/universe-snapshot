Filename basename
===============
2020-10-06



I've found that the words **filename** and **basename** can take different meaning depending on the contexts were they are used.
Here is my own definitions of those words, to set them once for all:



- filename: includes the file extension
- basename: does not include the file extension




Tip
------

To get the **filename**, you can use the [php basename function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.basename.php) (I know it's confusing...).

To get the **basename**, you can use [Bat's getBaseName method](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Bat/blob/master/FileSystemTool.md#getbasename).

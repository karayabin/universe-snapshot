Light_Kit_Admin_UserData, conception notes
==============
2020-02-25



This plugin hooks the [Light_UserData](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_UserData) plugin into the [Light_Kit_Admin](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Kit_Admin) environment.


In the **Light_Kit_Admin** environment, it will add a few menu items (and corresponding pages):

- a file manager ( user > file manager )
- some admin tables to administrate the **Light_UserData** plugin ( admin > Light_UserData > * )



My intent (as of 2020-02-25), is that the file manager looks something like this: https://zeroadmin.ovh/?p=pages/u-filemanager.

For the admin tables, they are just tables using the [Light_Realist](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Light_Realist) plugin.

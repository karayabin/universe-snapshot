Description

A concrete use case of when the removeFlash flag needs to be false (developer anecdote)
---------------
I was creating this admin backend, and the user didn't have the right to access a page, so I created a flash
telling her which specific right she was missing, and then redirected her to that forbidden page.
From there, the flash was available, and so I could tell her exactly which right she was missing.
However, I didn't want that if she refreshed the page, the message would be lost, so I used a persistent flash
message in this case.




Parameters
================


- id

    

- removeFlash

    


Return values
================

Returns array | false.

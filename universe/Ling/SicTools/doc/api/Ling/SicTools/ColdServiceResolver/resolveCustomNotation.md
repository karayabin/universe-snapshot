ColdServiceResolver::resolveCustomNotation
================



ColdServiceResolver::resolveCustomNotation â€” Parses the given value as a custom notation and returns the interpreted result.




Description
================


protected [ColdServiceResolver::resolveCustomNotation](https://github.com/lingtalfi/SicTools/blob/master/doc/api/Ling/SicTools/ColdServiceResolver/resolveCustomNotation.md)($value, ?$isCustomNotation = false) : mixed




Parses the given value as a custom notation and returns the interpreted result.

One of two cases happens:

- the given value is recognized as a custom notation:
     - the isCustomNotation flag is set to true (by the implementor)
     - the method returns the interpreted custom value

- the given value is NOT recognized as a custom notation:
     - the isCustomNotation flag is left to false (by default)
     - the method's return will be ignored


This mechanism allows us to create new notations based either on strings or arrays, for instance:

- @service(my.service)           # would call a service


Note: inside this method, you can create your own code blocks and add them to the stack.
See the examples in the documentation for more details.

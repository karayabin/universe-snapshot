JBee
===========
2020-07-31 -> 2020-10-05



A js library that I use sometimes.

It's basically a copy of [js-extension-ling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-extension-ling),
but without the npm stuff.

I added more functions as well.





This is part of the [universe framework](https://github.com/karayabin/universe-snapshot).


Install
==========
Using the [uni](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe-naive-importer) command.
```bash
uni import Ling/JBee
```

Or just download it and place it where you want otherwise.

Host planet
-----------
2020-11-12


Light_Kit_Admin sub planets, which name starts with the "Light_Kit_Admin_" prefix all have a **host planet** (aka origin planet).


The **host planet** name is the same name as the sub-planet, but without the **Kit_Admin_** prefix.


So for instance, if the sub-planet is:
 
- Light_Kit_Admin_UserData

Then the **host planet** is:

- Light_UserData


Usually, the **host planet** provides some database storage, and the sub-planet displays various items (i.e. lists, forms, menus, ...)
corresponding to those tables in the Light_Kit_Admin environment (in the case of a Light_Kit_Admin sub-planet).


As for now, Light_Kit_Admin sub-planets are the only ones that have a **host planet**.


This definition might be extended as new use cases are discovered.

Naming css classes
====================
Just ideas I had about how to name css classes.
  
Use the following convention: WHAT-WHERE.

For instance bold, or bold-dialog.


The idea here is that the WHAT is more important than the WHERE and therefore comes first.
The WHERE is optional, it is only required if the WHAT needs to be more specific on the target.

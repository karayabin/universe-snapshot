Site type
================
2017-05-15




Admittedly there is a pattern that many applications use: 

rather than having only one website,

some applications use a front office and a back office.


In kamille, we differentiate between the two types of applications:

- single applications (have only one website)
- dual applications (expose both a front office and a back office)


In order to help framework developers, we also provide the following configuration value:


- siteType: single | dual.front | dual.back


Developers can use this value to implement their logic.

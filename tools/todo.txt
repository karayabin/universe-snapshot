automate the workflow of creating snapshots:


- create zip directly,
- update the readme providing the size of the snapshot...


To create a snapshot manually:

copy the planets folder to the universe-snapshots dir and name it with the current date.
Run http://universe/get-bar-missing.php and remove the private projects.
run the cleaner to remove .git, and private, ...
zip the snapshot.
update the readme.
Worflow should be automated every 01 at midnight, or later (implement your cron system ?)

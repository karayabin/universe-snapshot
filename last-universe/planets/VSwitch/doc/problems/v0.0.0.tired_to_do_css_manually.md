So you can have a pretty good looking simple view switcher, just by creating your 
own css classes.
That's nice if you are in the mood, but even if you take the simplest example possible,
you need about 7 lines of css code to accomplish a switch.

I wish I could just type some one liner js code and have the same result.
I don't need fancy css, just a basic show/hide thing, or maybe jquery's fadeIn/fadeOut,
but no more.

I like that vswitch provides built-in show and fade mode.
It makes it easier than switching to the css stylesheet.

However, in some complex switchers* with multiple views, I might have different needs
depending on the view.
For instance view A should use show mode, while view B would render better with fade mode.


The current implementation doesn't allow me to do that.

Could it be implemented?

I suggest a mode third argument to the "view changing" methods, 
which would override the default mode whenever specified.
